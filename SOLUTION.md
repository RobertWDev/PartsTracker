# Solution Overview

## Architecture Overview

- **API Layer:** ASP.NET Core (.NET 8) entry point, exposes REST endpoints.
- **Modules:** 
  - **Parts Module:** Handles part management, uses `PartsDbContext`.
  - **Users Module:** Manages users, uses `UsersDbContext` and Outbox for event processing.
- **Database:** Entity Framework Core with automatic migrations.
- **Client:** JavaScript/TypeScript frontend (if present).
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, and architecture tests for reliability.

## Trade-offs

- **Automatic Migrations:** Simplifies deployment but may risk unintended schema changes in production.
- **Modular Structure:** Improves maintainability but increases initial complexity.
- **Outbox Pattern:** Adds reliability for event processing but requires periodic job execution.

## Security & Monitoring

- **Security:**
  - Use ASP.NET Core Identity or JWT for authentication.
  - Validate all inputs and use parameterized queries.
  - Restrict database permissions.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Integrate with Application Insights or similar for logging and metrics.
  - Use health checks and alerts for critical endpoints and background jobs.

## Cost Strategies

- **Cloud Deployment:** Use PaaS (e.g., Azure App Service, Azure SQL) for scalability.
- **Resource Optimization:** Scale database and compute resources based on usage.
- **CI/CD:** Automate builds and deployments to reduce manual overhead.
- **Monitoring:** Proactively monitor to avoid over-provisioning and optimize costs.
